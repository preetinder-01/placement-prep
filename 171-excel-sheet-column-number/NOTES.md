Let's take an example not given in question -
Suppose our string given to us is s = "AZ"
​
So, the representation of our string should be
pos of 'Z' in alphabtes is: 26
pos of 'A' in alphabets is: 1
​
But, In string "AZ",
'Z' is on unit place and it's pos value in alphabets is 26
and 'A' is on ten's digit and it's pos value in alphabets is 1
so, 'A' should be multiplied with 26.
Therefore, Final answer should be-
"AZ"
(1 * (26 ^ 1)) + (26 * (26 ^ 0))
(1 * 26) + (26 * 1)
(26) + (26)
52
​
The final answer should be 52.
