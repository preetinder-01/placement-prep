#Algorithm:
```
1. Create a map of int to int storing the number and its location in the array
2. Loop through the array
3. Find for the complement of the number in the map
4. If the complement is found, push the indices of the pair into the array
5. If not found then add the integer at ith position into the map
6. Return the result array
```
